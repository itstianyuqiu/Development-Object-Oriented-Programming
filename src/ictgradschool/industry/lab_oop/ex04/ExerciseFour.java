/**
 * Write a program that prompts the user to enter an amount and a number of decimal places.  The program should then
 * truncate the amount to the user-specified number of decimal places using String methods.
 *
 * <p>To truncate the amount to the user-specified number of decimal places, the String method indexOf() should be used
 * to find the position of the decimal point, and the method substring() should then be used to extract the amount to
 * the user-specified number of decimal places.  The program is to be written so that each task is in a separate method.
 * You need to write four methods, one method for each of the following tasks:</p>
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Printing the prompt and reading the amount from the user</li>
 *     <li>Printing the prompt and reading the number of decimal places from the user</li>
 *     <li>Truncating the amount to the user-specified number of DP's</li>
 *     <li>Printing the truncated amount</li>
 * </ul>
